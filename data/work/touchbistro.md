<p>
I had the privilege of leading the transformation of legacy enterprise .NET framework web applications into modern NodeJS and React applications. This involved not only rewriting the applications but also fully integrating them with our pre-existing company technology stack. Through this transformation, we were able to modernize our systems, improve performance, and enhance the overall user experience.
</p>
<p>
As part of this initiative, I introduced a robust CI/CD infrastructure, enabling our team to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes. This significantly streamlined our development workflow and allowed us to deliver updates more efficiently and reliably. I also guided the team in implementing workflow improvements around the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring seamless collaboration and maximizing productivity.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing the importance of mentorship, I took on the responsibility of providing guidance and support to intermediate and junior members of the team. Through regular mentorship sessions, I helped them enhance their skills, gain confidence, and grow professionally. This fostered a collaborative and inclusive team environment, ultimately leading to higher-quality deliverables.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, I identified and addressed performance bottlenecks in our SQL Server environment. By optimizing the database queries, indexes, and configurations, I was able to significantly improve the overall performance of our applications. This optimization effort resulted in substantial cost savings for the company, estimated to be nearly $100,000 in operating costs.
</p>
<p>
In summary, I successfully led the transformation of legacy applications, introduced a robust CI/CD infrastructure, provided mentorship to team members, and optimized SQL Server performance to deliver tangible benefits to the company.
