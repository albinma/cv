<p>
I have performed detailed and focused testing on the Energy & Environmental Management System under development at the time for York Region by Inovex. During this process, I provided excellent customer support during user application testing and requirement collection. Working closely with Clients, I effectively identified, reproduced, and triaged bug items while also collecting additional requirements during testing. To ensure a thorough understanding of the problem domain, I made sure to delve into the intricacies of each issue.

<p>
Collaborating closely with developers and business analysts, I played a vital role in crafting concise and easy-to-understand software manuals and training guides for our clients. This allowed them to navigate and utilize the system with ease. Additionally, I occasionally assisted developers with troubleshooting and fixing low priority bugs. By alleviating their workload in this way, I not only created opportunities for self-improvement but also fostered a smoother development process for the entire team.
