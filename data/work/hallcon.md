<p>
I have had the opportunity to build a custom enterprise management system from the initial white board sketches all the way to its production stage. Throughout the process, I played a crucial role in making architectural decisions, gathering requirements, and overseeing the development of both the web-based front-end application and the back-end systems.
</p>
<br />
<p>
In addition to that, I took the lead in architecting B2B systems that handle a significant portion of our order volume. With a strong emphasis on high availability and performance, I ensured that these systems could efficiently process incoming orders and deliver exceptional service to our clients.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Furthermore, I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive CI/CD system. This initiative had a profound impact on our development team's velocity and the overall quality of our software delivery. With streamlined processes in place, we experienced a drastic improvement in our ability to release updates and enhancements, ensuring a more efficient and reliable development workflow.
