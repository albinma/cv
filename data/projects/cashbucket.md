<p>
I seamlessly integrated Auth0 authentication and Stripe into the existing Blazor WASM app. It was an exciting challenge to bring these two powerful tools together, providing users with a streamlined and secure login process while enabling smooth payment transactions.
</p>
<p>
One of the key aspects of the integration was implementing automated user creation after a successful Stripe checkout. To achieve this, I utilized webhooks to receive real-time notifications from Stripe whenever a customer completed a checkout process. These webhooks triggered the necessary actions on our end, allowing us to automatically create user accounts and grant them access to the appropriate features and content.

<p>
Overall, it was a rewarding experience to see the app evolve with these new functionalities, enhancing the user experience and optimizing business operations.
