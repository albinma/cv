I played a key role in constructing B2B systems that seamlessly integrated with a large variety of ticketing providers in the travel industry. It was a complex task, but I enjoyed the challenge of building a versatile and robust system that could handle diverse data formats and API integrations to ensure smooth ticketing experiences for clients and their customers.

Throughout the project, I took the lead in guiding it from development to product launch. It was a rewarding experience to see the system evolve and mature, addressing various challenges and requirements along the way. My ability to collaborate with the team and maintain clear communication throughout the development lifecycle (not to mention wildly varying timezones across the team) proved crucial in achieving a successful product launch.

Undoubtedly, the ongoing pandemic presented unique challenges for the travel industry. I had to constantly adapt to the shifting landscape caused by time and resource constraints, as well as changing requirements in response to the pandemic's impacts. Flexibility and quick problem-solving skills were essential in navigating these hurdles and ensuring that our B2B systems remained relevant and effective in the ever-changing market.

Looking back, I am proud of the contributions I made to the project's success. Constructing and integrating with multiple ticketing providers while guiding the project to a successful launch, all amidst the challenges of the pandemic, demonstrated the ability to excel under pressure and adapt to dynamic circumstances. It was a gratifying experience to be part of a team that played a significant role in streamlining ticketing services for businesses and their customers within the travel industry.
