<p>
I had the opportunity to work on some exciting features for SparklesNFT where I played a crucial role in establishing the backend API architecture, providing real-time marketplace transaction data. It was a challenging but rewarding task to design a robust and efficient system that could handle high volumes of data while maintaining real-time updates for our users.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, I took on the responsibility of building a blockchain data ingestion engine using a combination of Graph Node, NodeJS and PostgreSQL. This engine was instrumental in retrieving and processing data from the blockchain, allowing us to present relevant and up-to-date information to our users. Working with blockchain technology was both fascinating and demanding, as it required a deep understanding of how to interact with the blockchain network effectively.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, I successfully integrated authorization and authentication for both frontend and backend applications using Ethereum addresses via Metamask and other well-known wallets. This integration allowed users to securely interact with the platform using their Ethereum addresses, providing a seamless and decentralized user experience. Ensuring the security and privacy of our users' data during this process was of utmost importance, and I;m glad I could implement a robust solution.
</p>
<p>
These projects were a significant milestone in my career, and I'm proud to have contributed to building innovative and cutting-edge technologies that benefited users and pushed the boundaries of what the application could achieve.
